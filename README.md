# Describe results of different weighting schemas and different relevance scores

TF-IDF(https://github.com/Droom1995/ddw_ht2/blob/master/TFIDF-Cosine.csv) approach is the best. 
TF(https://github.com/Droom1995/ddw_ht2/blob/master/TF-Cosine.csv) is slightly better than binary(https://github.com/Droom1995/ddw_ht2/blob/master/Bin-Cosine.csv).

# Describe/summarise/compare evaluation metrics

As we can see, F-measure for cosine evaluation metric is a lot better that euclidian, providing higher precision and recall.
